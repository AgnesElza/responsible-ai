## Responsible AI: A Practical Guide to Mitigating Bias in Machine Learning

### **Introduction**

This project notebook documents a hands-on approach to identifying, analyzing, and mitigating unfair bias in a machine learning model. Using the classic Adult Income dataset, this analysis demonstrates a full responsible AI workflow, from establishing a biased baseline to exploring and implementing various mitigation strategies. The ultimate goal is to build a model that performs equitably across different demographic groups, even when the underlying data is flawed.

### **Core Concepts Explored**

* **Identifying Bias**: We use subgroup analysis to expose performance disparities in a model, proving that relying solely on overall accuracy can be misleading.
* **Data-Centric Mitigation**: This project explores the challenges and trade-offs of a data-centric approach by attempting to mitigate bias through oversampling.
* **Model-Centric Mitigation**: We implement a more advanced, model-centric approach using the **Fairlearn** library to directly enforce fairness during the prediction phase.
* **The Iterative Nature of Responsible AI**: The notebook's narrative highlights that building fair technology is not a one-time fix but a continuous process of testing, learning, and making deliberate trade-offs.

### **Methodology**

The project follows a step-by-step methodology to illustrate the complete process:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial analysis is performed to identify data imbalances and potential sources of selection bias.
2.  **Baseline Model Training**: A Logistic Regression model is trained on the original, unbalanced data to establish a performance benchmark.
3.  **Subgroup Analysis**: The baseline model's performance is meticulously evaluated on sensitive subgroups (`sex` and `race`) to quantify the extent of the bias.
4.  **Data-Centric Mitigation Attempt**: Oversampling is applied to the training data, and a new model is trained to demonstrate the unintended consequences of this approach.
5.  **Model-Centric Mitigation with Fairlearn**: The `ThresholdOptimizer` from the Fairlearn library is implemented to fine-tune the model's predictions for a more equitable outcome.
6.  **Final Analysis and Conclusion**: The results of all models are compared side-by-side to draw conclusions on the most effective mitigation strategy for this project.

### **Getting Started**

To run this notebook, you'll need a Python environment with the following dependencies:

* `pandas`
* `scikit-learn`
* `matplotlib`
* `fairlearn`
* `imblearn`

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment like Conda to manage these dependencies and avoid conflicts.
